### Research Questions:
**Correlation Study:** Is there a specific correlation between weather factors (e.g., temperature, precipitation) and the number of rides provided by Uber and other FHV companies?\
**Demand Impact:** How does weather influence ride demand for Uber and other FHV (For-Hire Vehicles) companies in New York?\
**Strategic Planning:** Can correlations between weather and ride frequency be leveraged to plan driver promotions and increase ride shares?

### Hypothesis:
**Hypothesis:** Extreme weather conditions significantly affect the demand and geographic distribution of rides for Uber and other FHV companies.\
**Null Hypothesis:** Extreme weather conditions have no significant impact on the demand and geographic distribution of rides for Uber and other FHV companies.
