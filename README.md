* Walaa Youssef

### **Project Description:**
The aim of this project is to analyze the relationship between weather conditions and Uber ride
usage, especially during extreme weather conditions. The problem we address is whether weather conditions, ranging from subzero temperatures to scorching heat, influence the frequency of ride-sharing usage.

### Research Questions:
**Correlation Study:** Is there a specific correlation between weather factors (e.g., temperature, precipitation) and the number of rides provided by Uber and other FHV companies?\
**Demand Impact:** How does weather influence ride demand for Uber and other FHV (For-Hire Vehicles) companies in New York?\
**Strategic Planning:** Can correlations between weather and ride frequency be leveraged to plan driver promotions and increase ride shares?

### Hypothesis:
**Hypothesis:** Extreme weather conditions significantly affect the demand and geographic distribution of rides for Uber and other FHV companies.\
**Null Hypothesis:** Extreme weather conditions have no significant impact on the demand and geographic distribution of rides for Uber and other FHV companies.
